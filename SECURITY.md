# Reporting a Vulnerability

Whereby welcomes security researchers to report security vulnerabilities found in the Whereby Meetings, Whereby Embedded platforms and in any Whereby package in a manner that is in line with our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://whereby.com/information/security/vdp/).

For security vulnerabilities reported in the Whereby Meetings and Whereby Embedded platform, handling implications are detailed in [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://whereby.com/information/security/vdp/). 

For security vulnerabilities reported in Whereby packages, handling will be done on case by case basis depending on the severity of the finding, without committing to a fixed period of remediation.
